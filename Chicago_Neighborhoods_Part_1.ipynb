    "The main data comes from a Foursquare API for Chicago. This data contains neighborhoods and coordinates as well as venues such as restaurants or parks. Another dataset I might use with this one comes from the Community areas in Chicago Wikipedia article [1], which contains more information about the neighborhoods such as population and area (sq. ft). I think that area and population data would bring a more helpful analysis on neighborhoods such as how large are the communities and what does population density say about them. "
